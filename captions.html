<p><strong>IGTV Captions for December 7, 2020</strong></p>
<p>I'm William X Nietzche. I'm the eldest son of elders William and Julie Kinney, the owners of The Red House here on Mississippi. </p>
<p>On September 9th, 2020, my mother and father were forcibly removed at gunpoint by Multnomah County Sheriffs. Me, my brother, my uncle were also present during this forced removal at gunpoint.</p>
<p>As we tried to reason with these officers, because they didn't give us no notice that they were coming to remove us at gunpoint, we weren't even aware that we were subject to an eviction because we had a prior pending court actions against the defendants in this matter. So we weren't even given a heads up.</p>
<p>When we tried to reason with the sheriffs to not force us out under these conditions they put unreasonable demands on us to move out within minutes. They said we had 10 to 15 minutes to grab our lifetime worth of belongings stored in this house. I was born and raised in this house.</p>
<p>As we try to reason with the sheriffs, they seen we were getting frustrated and emotional about this forced removal, so they put me and my brother in the back of sheriffs' cars for about two hours, while my mother and father were forced to remove all our lifetime valuables out of our home. This was a humilitating act done by the Mulnomah County Sheriffs, and the effects have left trauma and stress.</p>
<p>And as we know, on August 31st, 2020, Governor Kate Brown extended the Emergency Moratorium on evictions and foreclosures here in Oregon until December 31st, 2020.</p>
<p>Even if you ignore the fact that this eviction and arrest has happened despite the questionable legal and moral grounds, Governor Kate Brown placed an eviction moratorium on all evictions starting April 1st, 2020, and was extended until December 21st, 2020. Which makes this whole situation and other situations like it that much more disgusting and morally and ethically irreprehensible.</p>
