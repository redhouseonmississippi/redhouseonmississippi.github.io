I then recognized him as Deputy Sheriff Jones,, who was carrying an assault rifle at the time of my family’s eviction. While kidnapped I was placed in, solitary confinement with no access to a phone.”>

They proceeded to forcibly evict the elderly William Kinney, Jr., his wife, , Julie Metcalf, and their two adult sons from their long-time family home. They even handcuffed and detained , the two sons in the patrol vehicle while removing the parents from their home., We are saddened to hear of families losing their homes to foreclosure, but assume they just didn’t pay their , mortgage. However, the Kinneys only had a relatively small second mortgage and it was not in default. Further, , the Kinneys made repeated efforts to clarify the situation and fight the intended foreclosure through the lenders , and the courts, but the judges of two courts still allowed the fraudulent foreclosure to proceed.">
