[Portland, Oregon] It’s been five months since Multnomah County Sheriffs and Portland Police Bureau raided the Afro-Indigenous Kinney family home and unlawfully arrested land defenders. And it’s been eight months since Kinney family elders were violently evicted during the summer 2020 wildfires. Over the winter and spring, the family continues to recover from the trauma of these raids and strengthen their legal defense — while still receiving death threats by white supremacists and slander from media outlets.">

While slander of Afro-Indigenous Kinney family continues, Kinney family successfully demands Mayor’s office to promise law enforcement will not take action against Red House occupants in exchange for reopening of city street. Portland, Ore.We are grateful for the support that people across the country and beyond have brought to the Kinney family’s battle against gentrification in real time—and we couldn’t be more energized to see what it looks like for a community to truly come together to support an Afro- Indigenous family. As we celebrate these big strides, it’s important to clarify the huge forces that the Kinney family continues to be up against. In the past week we’ve seen public officials, Portland Police, and Multnomah County Sheriffs brutalize the Kinney brothers and Red House land defenders, desecrate the Kinney family fourth-generation home, and publicly decry an Afro-Indigenous led grassroots movement to set a target on the backs of the Kinney family and their supporters.">
