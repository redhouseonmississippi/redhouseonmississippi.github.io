      <h2>The Kinney Family</h2>
      <p>
        We are raising <strong>$250k</strong> on GoFundMe to save the Kinney Family Home! Black families have been consistently gentrified and displaced from NE Portland (unceded Indigenous Chinookan land) for decades. Help keep the Kinney family rooted in their history. Help keep the Kinney family housed, for generations to come.

        You can also send funds directly through Venmo or Cash App to help with the family's immediate needs, including ongoing legal assistance and fees.
